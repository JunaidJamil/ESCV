The most suitable technique for performing quality assurance and inspection is deep learning. We have worked on the automation of manual processing of detecting defects and quality assurance of hair care products in the P & G industry, with efficient use of resources within minimum time. This project is in collaboration with P&G where an end-to-end system has been established using deep learning algorithms and machine vision approach. Hair Care product bottles have been selected as input and defects have been detected and categorised as E-TAMU (Targeted Acceptable, Marginal, and Unacceptable) in form of output. These defects include torn label, label adhesion, dents, scuff, and product spillage on bottles.",

        description: ":  Urdu OCR is an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The sole purpose of Urdu OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is preserving the essence of Urdu language in a digital form. Urdu OCR ensures to preserve our cultural heritage. Urdu is a rich and diverse language with a long history, by digitizing Urdu texts, Urdu OCR will guarantee that these documents are preserved for future generations and can be easily accessed and studied. It improves workflows and make it simpler to look for and evaluate Urdu documents. It enhances efficiency, and save time and effort by converting printed Urdu texts into editable digital formats rather than having to physically transcribe or type out the text. Urdu OCR technology has evolved significantly over the years, with the earliest attempts dating back to the 1980s. Early OCR systems were based on rule-based approaches that relied on a set of pre-defined rules to recognize individual characters and ligatures. However, these systems were limited in their accuracy and were not able to handle the variability and complexity of Urdu script. More recent OCR systems have adopted machine learning approaches, such as neural networks and deep learning, to improve accuracy and handling of complex scripts. These systems are trained on large datasets of annotated data, allowing them to learn the patterns and variations of Urdu script and to recognize complex ligatures and variations in font styles. Although our transformer based Urdu OCR model supports education and research by making it easier to access and study Urdu texts. This is particularly more useful for researchers and students working in fields like literature, history, and linguistics. It would also improve the accessibility, since many Urdu papers are only printed versions, people with visual impairments cannot access them. By converting these papers into digital formats that can be 10 read by assistive technologies like screen readers, Urdu OCR can aid in making them accessible.",

        description: "In response to Karachi's persistent traffic congestion caused by an outdated traffic signal system, a collaboration between NCL, Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) and the Sindh Traffic Police has proposed an Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This advanced system utilizes in-pavement detectors like cameras and employs deep learning algorithms to monitor traffic flow in real-time. By dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings based on current demand, the ITS ensures smooth traffic flow, reduces congestion, prioritizes emergency vehicles, minimizes accidents, and lowers carbon emissions. Beyond immediate benefits, the ITS demonstrates a proactive and sustainable approach to enhancing Karachi's urban transportation infrastructure.",
